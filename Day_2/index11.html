      <li>
        Awarded the SIAM Kleinman Prize for his many contributions to the
        analysis and computation of hyperbolic equations and their applications
        in science and engineering, and for his<br />
        mentoring of young scientists and service to the scientific community.
        His many innovations in numerical schemes for conservation laws and
        Hamilton-Jacobi equations and in the <br />
        development of the level set method and its applications have had
        enormous impact across disciplinary boundaries in image processing,
        control, flow simulation, and many other fields.
